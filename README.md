Hi, my name is Pavel Savchuk and I'm a programmer.

I've been working on building various web apps for the last few years, and now I'm looking for opportunity to make a shift into more low-level programming.

It's fascinating for me to figure out how computers really work, and so I'm studying compilers, operating systems, and, of course, all the vastness of good ol' C language.
